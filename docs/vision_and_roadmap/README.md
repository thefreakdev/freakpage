# Vision & Roadmap

## Vision
 
Freak Cloud is a decentralized data storage platform tailored for zkSync, aiming to achieve broad adoption among both cryptocurrency enthusiasts and everyday users.

To achieve this vision, we have identified four core pillars:

**Decentralization**: We believe that true decentralization is critical to the success of a data storage platform. With Freak Cloud, we plan to take decentralization to the next level. Anyone can become a storage provider on Freak Cloud, without censorship or the need for whitelisting. We aim to lower the barriers to entry for storage providers by enabling individuals to provide storage using a wide range of devices, from personal computers to smartphones, with minimal hardware requirements. In doing so, we hope to create a broad network of storage providers, attracting both zkSync users and non-crypto users, and fostering a more decentralized ecosystem.

**Performance and Efficiency**: High performance and efficiency are essential to the success of a decentralized data storage platform. Freak Cloud utilizes Merkle tree storage proofs to significantly reduce computational costs and power consumption, resulting in a more efficient platform. We have chosen to deploy Freak Cloud on zkSync, a leading zk rollup solution for Ethereum, to leverage its high throughput, low gas fees, and substantial user base. With zkSync's infrastructure, Freak Cloud can achieve high-performance scaling, minimizing gas fees and attracting a broad user base.

**Sustainability**: Ensuring the sustainability of our platform is a top priority for Freak Cloud. We understand the concerns users may have about decentralized data storage, such as the risks of not being able to retrieve their data or the potential need to pay tips for downloads. With our freak incentive model, Freak Cloud addresses these concerns by implementing mechanisms to prevent fraud and ensure data availability, creating a more reliable and user-friendly platform. We believe that by mitigating attack vectors, incentivizing positive behavior, and prioritizing user benefits, we can build a sustainable platform that users can trust.

**User-Friendly Experience**: Creating a user-friendly experience is key to accelerating mass adoption of Freak Cloud among both crypto and non-crypto users. We have integrated an on-chain order book for storage pricing, allowing users and storage providers to easily match with one another. Additionally, we are committed to designing client software for both PCs and smartphones that is as simple and easy to use as possible.

In summary, Freak Cloud aspires to be a decentralized data storage platform that is genuinely adopted by a broad spectrum of users. By focusing on decentralization, performance and efficiency, sustainability, and user experience, we aim to create a platform that meets the needs of our users and fosters a more decentralized ecosystem.
