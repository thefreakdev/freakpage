# Order Book for Storage Price on zkEVM

In Freak Cloud, storage prices are determined by the supply and demand of the storage market. Users and storage providers can choose between market price or spot price for storage. All transactions and orders are transparently recorded on zkSync.

The storage market price is a real-time balance between supply and demand. When users or storage providers select this price, their orders are processed immediately.

The storage spot price is the price users are willing to pay for uploading data or the price providers want to be paid for storing data.

More details about the order book for storage price on zkEVM will be updated soon.
