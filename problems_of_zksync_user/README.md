# Problems when zkSync users use other Decentralized Data Storage Solutions

1. **Additional fees**: Existing decentralized data storage platforms require users to transfer tokens from the zkSync ecosystem to the chains of those platforms to use their services. This bridging process incurs additional fees, increasing the overall cost of using storage services.

2. **Security Risks**: When interacting with decentralized storage solutions on separate blockchains, security of zkSYnc users relies on cross-chain bridges and storage chains. These are additional points of vulnerability, introducing security risks that do not exist when operating on zkSync solely. 	

3. **Inconvenience in Transaction Tracking**: As transactions are spread across two different blockchains, users have to monitor both the zkSync blockchain and the storage blockchain in order to keep track of their transactions. This can be cumbersome and inconvenient.
