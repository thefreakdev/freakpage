# FAQ: Why doesn't Freak Cloud require a Layer 1 solution like Filecoin or Arweave to function?

To confirm that storage providers have indeed stored users' data, they need to upload a storage proof to the blockchain or an EVM. However, uploading a conventional storage proof to an EVM can be impractical due to high gas fees and slow speeds. This is why other decentralized data storage solutions require their own Layer 1 to customize gas fees.

With Merkle-tree cryptographic proofs, the proof size is significantly reduced. Moreover, the zk-rollup environment of zkSync enables the storage verification process on Freak Cloud to be carried out on zkSync efficiently, with high speed and minimal gas fees.
