# zkEVM Smart Contract

Freak Cloud's smart contract, which runs on zkSync, serves several purposes:
1. It maintains an order book storage price where users and storage providers can place orders. Transactions are processed on zkSync with low gas fees and high speed.
2. It verifies data storage proof on-chain to ensure proper data storage.
3. It hosts the incentivization and anti-fraud model, ensuring a trustless process.
