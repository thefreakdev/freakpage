This model encourages providers to deliver top-notch services, eliminates fraud, and secures the network."},"components/merkle/README":{"id":"components/merkle/README","title":"Merkle Tree-Based Proof","description":"Our system stands out by integrating a Merkle proof system to ensure correctness from both the user and the provider, boasting an extremely small proof size and low verification cost.","sidebar":"mainSidebar"},"components/nodes":{"id":"components/nodes","title":"Freak Cloud Nodes","description":"Freak Cloud nodes facilitate data transfers and storage between users and storage providers.

Storage providers must periodically submit storage proof for the data they have stored to the Freak Cloud Contract on zkEVM, which automatically verifies it on-chain. If the proof is valid, the storage provider is fine, but if not, the provider will be penalized.","sidebar":"mainSidebar"},"components/README":{"id":"components/README","title":"Components of Freak Cloud","description":"Freak Cloud consists of five main components:","sidebar":"mainSidebar"},"components/zkevm_contract":{"id":"components/zkevm_contract","title":"zkEVM Smart Contract","description":"Freak Cloud\'s smart contract, which runs on zkSync, serves several purposes:","sidebar":"mainSidebar"},"erasure_coding/README":{"id":"erasure_coding/README","title":"Erasure coding","description":"Erasure coding is the technology that allow Freak Cloud lower storage size that each storage providers should store, thus lower storage price for users.","sidebar":"mainSidebar"},"FAQ/no_layer_one/README":{"id":"FAQ/no_layer_one/README","title":"FAQ: Why doesn\'t Freak Cloud require a Layer 1 solution like Filecoin or Arweave to function?","description":"To confirm that storage providers have indeed stored users\' data, they need to upload a storage proof to the blockchain or an EVM. However, uploading a conventional storage proof to an EVM can be impractical due to high gas fees and slow speeds. This is why other decentralized data storage solutions require their own Layer 1 to customize gas fees.","sidebar":"mainSidebar"},"FAQ/README":{"id":"FAQ/README","title":"FAQ","description":"You can ask our AI Freak chatbot in the right corner of the website or read some common questions in this thread","sidebar":"mainSidebar"},"freak_solution/README":{"id":"freak_solution/README","title":"Freak Cloud solution","description":"No Separate Blockchain Required:  Freak Cloud operates on zkEVM of zkSync, eliminating the need for a separate blockchain, cross-chain solutions, bridge fees, and enhancing security.","sidebar":"mainSidebar"},"overview/README":{"id":"overview/README","title":"Freak Cloud overview","description":"Freak Cloud is the first decentralized data storage dApp built on the zkEVM of zkSync without the need for a separate blockchain to function.
