# Freak Cloud overview

Freak Cloud is the first decentralized data storage dApp built on the zkEVM of zkSync without the need for a separate blockchain to function. Users and dapps on zkSync can store data on Freak Cloud, avoiding additional fees from cross-chain solutions and enhancing security.

Freak Cloud facilitates secure data transfers and storage through its nodes, utilizing an on-chain protocol on zkSync with efficient Merkle-tree storage proofs for minimal computational cost and power for data integrity.

Individuals can join Freak Cloud as either users seeking data storage or as storage providers aiming to earn rewards. Users upload their data to Freak Cloud, where it is encrypted and stored in a decentralized manner by data providers. The storage price is genuinely determined by user demand and storage provider supply, and anyone can become a storage provider, preserving the platform's decentralized nature.

Freak Cloud integrates an on-chain order book of storage prices, where users and storage providers can place spot or market orders for storage pricing, conveniently matching user and storage provider demands.

The Incentivization model of Freak Cloud ensures trustless and sustainable data storage, eliminates frauds, tackles infamous data withholding problems and ensures data availability at any time.

Built on the zkSync platform, combined with Merkle-tree storage proofs, Freak Cloud can achieve high scalability with hyper gas fee minimization.
