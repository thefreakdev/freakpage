# Incentivization model on ZkEVM

The incentivization model is a unique protocol implemented on zkEVM that effectively rewards storage providers for both data storage and up-time. This model encourages providers to deliver top-notch services, eliminates fraud, and secures the network.

The incentivization model consists of various mechanisms and solutions aimed at reducing fraudulent motivation and incentivizing storage providers. This model addresses issues encountered by existing decentralized data storage platforms.

One mechanism employed by Freak Cloud is allowing users to pay a predetermined amount for each download, incentivizing providers to offer better hosting quality. What sets this model apart is that users must lock in the payment first and cannot withdraw it, but they can decide whether or not to pay. Since users would lose money regardless, they are more likely to pay the provider afterward. Additionally, providers can choose not to send data if users repeatedly raise download requests without releasing the promised reward.

With this model, Freak Cloud effectively tackles a problem that many decentralized data storage platforms struggle with: providers may store data and submit data storage proofs while not sending the data to users. Because providers can be incentivized, they are more likely to be online and provide data to users when needed. They are also motivated to offer the best service possible to receive rewards and potentially earn higher rewards in the future. If they fail to deliver data to users, they will not receive any rewards. Consequently, Freak Cloud's model eliminates potential fraud by providers.

Furthermore, user data is encrypted and hosted by multiple providers through Freak Cloud. This not only increases the likelihood of having at least one valid host but also encourages providers to compete against each other to offer the best service and receive incentives, thus minimizing fraud. Additionally, this approach enhances decentralization in the data hosting process.
