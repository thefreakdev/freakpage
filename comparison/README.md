# Comparing Freak Cloud to Other Data Storage Solutions

Freak Cloud offers exceptionally low service fees and performance comparable to major centralized cloud services, thanks to data providers from around the world. It maintains decentralization and transparency while providing powerful services similar to AWS, Azure, or Google Cloud, but in a decentralized manner.

Moreover, Freak Cloud addresses issues found in existing decentralized data storage solutions. Concerned about the high cost of on-chain data storage? Freak Cloud's data storage cost is extremely low, rivaling that of centralized cloud providers, while maintaining on-chain data storage security levels. Worried about data loss on IPFS? Freak Cloud ensures data hosting quality through an incentivization model and a proof of storage protocol.

Several projects have attempted to move data storage and transfer off-chain while using an on-chain protocol to ensure work quality. Let's examine how Freak Cloud outperforms its competitors:

1. Filecoin: As one of the most popular decentralized data storage solutions, Filecoin faces two main issues. First, its computationally intensive data sealing and unsealing processes make it impractical for many use cases. In contrast, Freak Cloud employs a simple proof of storage protocol based on Merkle trees. Second, Filecoin entrusts data storage to miners, resulting in significant incentive problems. After Filecoin's launch, many miners committed to storing data but later discarded it because hosting was not worthwhile. In Freak Cloud, anyone can host data, and its smart incentivization model avoids such incentive issues.

2. Arweave: Arweave's security model assumes that rapidly accessible storage will perpetually become cheaper, and several other major assumptions are concerning and unsustainable for the future. Freak Cloud operates dynamically and flexibly, with users and providers deciding for themselves, rather than relying on uncertain assumptions. Arweave also faces the same issues as Filecoin, which Freak Cloud overcomes.

3. Sia: Sia's shortcomings lie not in its data storage proof system or incentivization model, but in its blockchain. Sia's blockchain lacks support for data pruning or light clients, requiring users running a node to store the entire blockchain's data. At present, this amounts to approximately 32 GB and will continue to grow. This raises the question: "If we have the hardware to store that much data, why would we need your software in the first place?" It also does not provide supports for IPFS, missing out on a large userbase that already has applications built with barebone IPFS. Developers have to costly adapt with Sia's own system, losing all of the features and plugins that the larger IPFS community have already built.

In conclusion, Freak Cloud stands out among its competitors by offering a powerful, low-cost, and secure decentralized data storage solution that addresses the issues found in other platforms.
