It maintains decentralization and transparency while providing powerful services similar to AWS, Azure, or Google Cloud, but in a decentralized manner.","sidebar":"mainSidebar"},"components/incentivization":{"id":"components/incentivization","title":"Incentivization model on ZkEVM","description":"The incentivization model is a unique protocol implemented on zkEVM that effectively rewards storage providers for both data storage and up-time. This model encourages providers to deliver top-notch services, eliminates fraud, and secures the network."},"components/merkle/README":{"id":"components/merkle/README","title":"Merkle Tree-Based Proof","description":"Our system stands out by integrating a Merkle proof system to ensure correctness from both the user and the provider, boasting an extremely small proof size and low verification cost.","sidebar":"mainSidebar"},"components/nodes":{"id":"components/nodes","title":"Freak Cloud Nodes","description":"Freak Cloud nodes facilitate data transfers and storage between users and storage providers. The user interface (UI) and user experience (UX) of Freak Cloud nodes are designed to be user-friendly, enabling storage providers to run nodes and interact with the platform without any coding knowledge.","sidebar":"mainSidebar"},"components/pricing":{"id":"components/pricing","title":"Order Book for Storage Price on zkEVM","description":"In Freak Cloud, storage prices are determined by the supply and demand of the storage market. Users and storage providers can choose between market price or spot price for storage. All transactions and orders are transparently recorded on zkSync.","sidebar":"mainSidebar"},"components/pricing/pricing":{"id":"components/pricing/pricing","title":"Order Book for Storage Price on zkEVM","description":"In Freak Cloud, storage prices are determined by the supply and demand of the storage market.

All transactions and orders are transparently recorded on zkSync."},"components/proof":{"id":"components/proof","title":"Cryptographic Data Storage Proof","description":"To guarantee that storage providers store the data and don\'t commit fraud while running their nodes, Freak Cloud employs a data storage proof system. Storage providers must periodically submit storage proof for the data they have stored to the Freak Cloud Contract on zkEVM, which automatically verifies it on-chain. If the proof is valid, the storage provider is fine, but if not, the provider will be penalized.","sidebar":"mainSidebar"},"components/README":{"id":"components/README","title":"Components of Freak Cloud","description":"Freak Cloud consists of five main components:","sidebar":"mainSidebar"},"components/zkevm_contract":{"id":"components/zkevm_contract","title":"zkEVM Smart Contract","description":"Freak Cloud\'s smart contract, which runs on zkSync, serves several purposes:","sidebar":"mainSidebar"},"erasure_coding/README":{"id":"erasure_coding/README","title":"Erasure coding","description":"Erasure coding is the technology that allow Freak Cloud lower storage size that each storage providers should store, thus lower storage price for users.","sidebar":"mainSidebar"},"freak_solution/README":{"id":"freak_solution/README","title":"Freak Cloud solution","description":"No Separate Blockchain Required:  Freak Cloud operates on zkEVM of zkSync, eliminating the need for a separate blockchain, cross-chain solutions, bridge fees, and enhancing security.","sidebar":"mainSidebar"},"no_layer_one/README":{"id":"no_layer_one/README","title":"FAQ: Why doesn\'t Freak Cloud require a Layer 1 solution like Filecoin or Arweave to function?","description":"To confirm that storage providers have indeed stored users\' data, they need to upload a storage proof to the blockchain or an EVM. However, uploading a conventional storage proof to an EVM can be impractical due to high gas fees and slow speeds. This is why other decentralized data storage solutions require their own Layer 1 to customize gas fees.","sidebar":"mainSidebar"},"problems_of_zksync_user/README":{"id":"problems_of_zksync_user/README","title":"Problems when zkSync users use other Decentralized Data Storage Solutions","description":"1. Additional fees: Existing decentralized data storage platforms require users to transfer tokens from the zkSync ecosystem to the chains of those platforms to use their services. This bridging process incurs additional fees, increasing the overall cost of using storage services.","sidebar":"mainSidebar"},"problems/README":{"id":"problems/README","title":"Problems with other Decentralized Data Storage Solutions","description":"Lack of Incentives and Sustainability in IPFS","sidebar":"mainSidebar"},"README":{"id":"README","title":"Freak Cloud overview","description":"Freak Cloud is the first decentralized data storage dApp built on the zkEVM of zkSync without the need for a separate blockchain to function.
