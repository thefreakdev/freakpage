# Freak Cloud Nodes

Freak Cloud nodes facilitate data transfers and storage between users and storage providers. The user interface (UI) and user experience (UX) of Freak Cloud nodes are designed to be user-friendly, enabling storage providers to run nodes and interact with the platform without any coding knowledge.

In essence, anyone with spare storage on devices such as PCs, laptops, and other hardware can run Freak Cloud nodes. The platform is currently under development, with plans to make it possible for users to run nodes on their smartphones, promoting mass adoption and real-world applications.

Freak Cloud also integrates IPFS into its nodes, taking advantage of the widespread use and numerous tools built around IPFS. This integration allows Freak Cloud nodes to inherit the ecosystem and attract greater awareness.
